# Wud
Wud (ود) is a mobile application developed for individuals or associations seeking to make meaningful contributions to their communities by offering their resources, skills, and project ideas. Additionally, it serves as a platform for community members in need of assistance, enabling them to request support from associations.

**Challenge :**
In Tunisia, we're facing significant challenges on our path to development. The economic crisis that followed the revolution [1] has taken a toll on our infrastructure, especially in education and healthcare where we're dealing with a shortage of medical professionals due to political instability and worsening working conditions.[2] Pollution is another major issue, with waste levels skyrocketing and environmental damage getting worse. The lack of proper waste management adds to the problem.[3] Early education is also struggling, with very few children enrolled in pre-primary programs. This could have serious long-term effects on our society and economy.[4] And to top it off, unemployment rates are high, especially among college graduates, showing deeper problems in our job market.[5]

**Solution:**
Tackling these challenges demands collective action. That's where Wud comes in. Inspired the initiative of https://jamaity.org/ . Wud is meant empower Tunisians to contribute to community improvement projects. NGOs and individuals can propose initiatives aimed at tackling pressing issues such as infrastructure development, educational advancement, economic empowerment, and reducing unemployment. Through Wud, users can offer resources, expertise, or volunteer efforts to support these projects. Additionally, they can seek assistance from associations when faced with challenges, fostering a collaborative approach to overcoming obstacles and driving positive change in Tunisia.

# Wud
Wud (ود) is a mobile application developed for individuals or associations seeking to make meaningful contributions to their communities by offering their resources, skills, and project ideas. Additionally, it serves as a platform for community members in need of assistance, enabling them to request support from associations. 

**Challenges :**
In Tunisia, we're facing significant challenges on our path to development. The economic crisis [1] that followed the revolution has left our infrastructure, notably healthcare, struggling with the exodus of medical professionals due to political instability and worsening conditions [2]. Pollution levels are escalating, worsening environmental damage due to inadequate waste management [3]. Early education enrollment remains low, which could have serious long-term effects on our society and economy.[4] And to top it off, unemployment rates are high, especially among college graduates, showing deeper problems in our job market. [5].

Tackling these challenges demands collective action. That's where Wud comes in. It's a mobile app inspired  the initiative of https://jamaity.org/. Wud empowers Tunisians to contribute to community improvement projects. NGOs and individuals can propose initiatives aimed at tackling pressing issues such as infrastructure development, educational advancement, economic empowerment, and reducing unemployment. Through Wud, users can offer resources, expertise, or volunteer efforts to support these projects. Additionally, they can seek assistance from associations when faced with challenges, fostering a collaborative approach to overcoming obstacles and driving positive change in Tunisia. 

This project is ultimately meant to englobe all of the SDGs, as long as the NGOs and individuals providing community projects within the application are committed to solving the SDGs that their local community needs. I was inspired to provide users with the freedom to choose what problems they could work on in order to achieve the purpose of the application, which is committing NGOs and individuals to work on the common goals and vision of the betterment of their community.

To make this app simpler to navigate, I focused on providing 4 SDGs that address fundamental challenges faced by communities in Tunisia:

**Goal 4:** Quality Education
_Target 4.1:_ By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.

**Goal 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth
_Target 8.5:_ By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.

**Goal 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities
_Target 11.3:_ By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.

**Goal 17:** Partnerships for the Goals
_Target 17.17:_ Encourage and promote effective public, public-private, and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships.
